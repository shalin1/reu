Do the appropriate facilitation for the now completed paragraph (no need to follow the paragraph s facilitation goto trail if there is one). 3) Next, start a new paragraph by going to Identity again for the second identity found that is shadowing the first seeding source or Seeding 13 identity, and again follow its Identity goto trail and facilitate with the first facilitation file to come up in that paragraph (again, no need to follow that facilitation s goto trail if there is one).  If the session continues now, the second shadowing identity is treated as the seeding source for the remainder of the session. Note: If Implant comes up in either Identity paragraph, or later in the session, it is active in both seeding sources. There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm.  - Willa Cather ","","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""" Chains","Haze Outer","HEART","EXHAUSTION","MINDFIELD","Seeing","Innerworld","Inversion","Persona","Psychic","Little Devil","Powerdrive","Excuse","IMPLANTIndex","Res Relate","AUTHORITY","Frailty","Qi Letting Go","Trespassing","CRF","CONSTRUCT","Yinflow","Overpower","Held","Powerdrive","Decision","Aversion","Qi Trails","Vessel","Fixation","Move","Story","Crisis Inner","Movement and flow through both incarnate and discarnate life can be hindered, stunted or halted.

It watches the moon and the planets, the days and seasons, the cycle of life and death all going around in an endless loop, and unconsciously, believing itself to be nature, the mind echoes these cycles. Its thoughts go in loops, repeating patterns established so long ago we often can t remember their origin, or why they ever made sense to us. And even when these loops fail over and over again to bring us to a desirable place, even while they entrap us, and make us feel anciently tired of ourselves, and we sense that sticking to their well-worn path means we ll miss contact with the truth every single time, we still find it nearly impossible to resist them. We call these patterns of thought our  nature  and resign ourselves to being governed by them as if they are the result of a force outside of us, the way that the seas are governed   rather absurdly, when one thinks about it   by a distant and otherwise irrelevant moon.  -

It also comes with implant activation instructions for the suffering, conflict, self limitation and suppression the being is to take on as  defense  against its infinite nature (see Membrane). This makes the pre-body being believe it is the body.Over one s lifetime however, the pre-body s Prime 1 magnetic pull can tend to pull other discarnate beings within the interior of one s organic life form who are experiencing similar  defense  instructions from their own Prime 1. The facilitation here releases these beings from their entrapment within one s life form and lightens the load of their additional  defense  instructions burdening one.Prime 1 s Breakout is  The light of love  1) Assess Implant Trance for the feelings emanating in one from the implant.2) Assess this file for the imagination event.3) Client alpha  breathes (eyes up on inhale, down on exhale) until they sense a release.

Tap In.(Note: At this point, if the TL in Seeding 27 indicates a) the client as a pre-body was drawn inside another life form, muscle question what that life form was. Then TL for the pre-body s location in that life form and the time this happened (Year Chart), then have the client feel what it is like to be located inside that life form ... Tap In. Have the client simply bathe all around them in that location with the light of their love until they can feel themselves as a pre-body joyfully releasing from that life form. Then do step 5).

We are going to look inside the body at the inner side of the spine. Starting from the bottom of the spine and moving upwards, I will indicate a spot, and you will see a pre-body there as a dark egg shaped form holding onto the inner side of the body s spine at that spot. We will continue to keep moving upwards along the spine and then onto the surface and interior of the brain, spotting pre-bodies.  - Start TLing and indicating each pre-body as they TL ... with each one  Look directly at this one and embrace it with the light of your love until it leaves you and feels the joy of its freedom.

To prevent falling into what one fears to be the bottomless pit of uncertainty about the future, one retreats into an artificial certainty by discarding the open possibilities of one s infinite life. Clutch is about jammed reflectiveness and taking on rigid and limiting belief systems that justify one s fear of experiencing freedom. Because such belief systems are based on misinformation disguised as the truth in order to create tribal binding, those with an active Clutch force can only retain their certainty by both manipulating others to believe the same way as they do (cults, sects, etc.) and by forcefully resisting any efforts by others to reveal the falsity of their belief. Examples of such false certainties include, amongst many, those based on the final and literal truth of mere stories, the belief in elitism, or the justifying of harm to others as the  right  thing to do. Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.  - Gustav Mahler","","","","","2","1","A covert defensiveness is being passed onto one by the seeding source","In essence, one is experiencing the force of the seeding source s dread of an unwanted future","A false belief in the  virtue  of struggle or failure has been adopted as a  solution  to one s overwhelm","There is a culturally driven paradigm conflicting with one s ability to foresee what is to come","An evil purpose is pulsing within what is being passed onto one here (find evil intention, go to Monster)","Crushed by a sense of emotional vulnerability, one holds a false belief around one like armor","Believing that one burdens others in some way keeps underwriting one s presence with the need to belong","A false outlook is being taken on that makes one despair of ever being able to attain what one hopes for","One is succumbing to a system of belief based on misinformation established to control others","The anxiety here is being amplified by the seeding source s struggle with disappointment","Inwardly trapped by a prohibition passed onto one by culture, religion or family","The tension of this is making one fear that attaining the success or healing that one wants is a delusion","An implant shared with the seeding source has kept smothering the magic in one to create miraculous change","The seeding source s alarm at confronting the damaging force here can now be soothed and overcome ","An unworthiness grips one and smothers one s trust in oneself","The barrier here is an absorbed and/or inherited need to assert one s rightness by seeing the wrong in others","This has been promoting the falsity that the power one truly has is not really so and that one will not succeed","The effect of a demonic paradigm holding the seeding source has been furthering one s insecurity here","There is also a still existing parasitic force gripping one with the seeding source s fear of being exposed as weak","Inwardly one is here harboring the seeding source s fear and loathing of the pain within their inner world","Acceptance of a negative or harmful intention that justifies a set of false beliefs ","This was behind the seeding source s desire for death and an end of involvement with their material world","And a code is boxing one into a hesitation to go beyond this self limiting paradigm one is caught in here ","A suppressive projection is manipulating one s intentions in order to prevent one s realization of the truth","The seeding source s believing themselves to be a  victim  acted upon by  villains  is leaking into one s outlook","In sum, one is unknowingly taking on the seeding source s self repression and despair here","With all this, one is unable to allow oneself unconditional pleasure and hesitant before the possibility of miracles","This can demand of one to dismiss one s own valid power and surrender to others  judgments and opinions","One is being driven into frustration by absorption of the seeding source s shamed sense of insignificance","With this, one becomes unable to see the amusing texture of life, and one retracts into a rigid uncertainty","Sexual trauma or problematic union in a sexual partnership has corrupted one s sense of what is real ","The seeding source us passing on a set of false beliefs that aggravate one s fears by invalidating one s truth"" Suppression","Outcast","ESCAPE","Survival","EXHAUSTION","Nurture","Weary","HEART","Clamp","REJECTING","EVIL*","Curse","Illness","Powerdrive","Compression","Trespassing","DEMONIC*","Genetic","Receptacle","IMPLANTindex","CODE","Dark Levels","Overwhelm","MAZE","VULNERABLE","CRF","Death","ATTACH*","Ancestor","INTRUDER*","Yoke","EM ","INFLOW","Suppression allows access to the urge within an identity with suppressive tendencies to bring untruth, fear, conflict, inertia and death into this world.

Conversely, by following the  hot  thread of forces imaged within a dream, processing can be taken to its fulfillment of a clean release of the impacting forces. Membrane refers to an event horizon, embedded with the implants, which surrounds the overall dream of this universe being generated by the beings within it. It is, in essence, a skin of suffering and self-limitation that acts as a  defense  against ourselves as infinite creators,  This membrane holds the  defense  together by trapping the force trails of the implants that are keeping each being in the dream and halting their processing. Without the membrane barrier calling in the limits of a being s experience, the physical universe dream would process out and  disappear  and the being would realize themselves as an infinite creator. The purpose of this file is to untangle the individual s menu of  defensive  implant activation so that one s entrapment in the material dream causatively transcended.Important: Membrane indicates a shift in one s awareness towards a more lucid existence (full scale awareness that one is dreaming this existence) with a consequent growth in intimacy and compassion.

To prevent falling into what one fears to be the bottomless pit of uncertainty about the future, one retreats into an artificial certainty by discarding the open possibilities of one s infinite life. Clutch is about jammed reflectiveness and taking on rigid and limiting belief systems that justify one s fear of experiencing freedom. Because such belief systems are based on misinformation disguised as the truth in order to create tribal binding, those with an active Clutch force can only retain their certainty by both manipulating others to believe the same way as they do (cults, sects, etc.) and by forcefully resisting any efforts by others to reveal the falsity of their belief. Examples of such false certainties include, amongst many, those based on the final and literal truth of mere stories, the belief in elitism, or the justifying of harm to others as the  right  thing to do. Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.  - Gustav Mahler","","","","","2","2","One is justifying a false understanding one has absorbed or inherited that acts to compress one s vision","One is allowing oneself to be overruled by tribal, family or a collective s projections of let down and failure","Stunned by the non-responsiveness of one s outer world, one is retreating from one s natural boldness","The fear of being abandoned or of failing drives one into the arms of an untruthful array of invalidating beliefs","Family or cultural pressures that usurp one s inner strength drive one into accepting a false belief","One is being corrupted by a false belief and pressured into it by one s family, religion or culture","A repeating drama from a true other life pushes one into the escapist  explanation  of a false belief system","Wholeness of heart, mind and body is being stained by a false belief regarding the nature of existence","The self-perceived barrenness of existence draws one into beliefs that corrupt the truth","One cannot separate from an identity in the seeding source that is entangled in false beliefs and despair","A confused need for inner certainty makes one reject the surprising and supportive ways of Grace","A family, cultural or religious system of beliefs prevents one from embracing the divine s supportive love","Loss of the confidence to deal with a reality makes one fall into a fantasy matrix that promises relief","Disappointment and uncertainty makes one hunger to belong to the  success  of a false system of belief","Lacking self-esteem and prone to falsely accusing others, one turns to a false belief to justify one s behavior","Adopting a system of false beliefs as  punishment  of self or others for creative expansiveness ","Unable to trust and fearing betrayal, one is led to bitterly withdraw & try to manipulate others psychically","The seeding source s sense of shame is driving one to  hide out  in a sense of powerlessness","The worry about the direction one is being made to take here pushes one to imagine untrue future events ","The seduction of a despairing religious or cultural belief defeats one s sense of real growth and change ","A false system of belief taken on because one feels otherwise unable to control oneself in some way","Inner urges (usually sexual or power driven) and loss of courage feeds one into false beliefs","The seeding source s belief that one has to suffer in order to  earn  the divine s love is undermining one s nobility","Unable to taste sweetness in life, feeling unprotected and lacking confidence, one is hooked into false beliefs","The pervasive despair around oneself and the seeding source is urging one to lose hope in succeeding","An anxiety within one that stems from past family, religious or cultural justifications for punishment or rejection ","The despair in one is imbuing an inherited or absorbed damaging way of thinking with a veneer of authenticity","Wearing the face of a false persona to prevent oneself from bringing forward one s true power","Reflexive alignment with damaging inner forces keeps prodding one to adopt a false belief about oneself ","As a result, one s finds oneself haunted by a confused sense that one has lost one s way","Stress in the present pushes one into the failures and confusions of one s past ","Overwhelmed by the will of others, the seeding source was unable to resist their untrue set of beliefs"" Implant 4 Breakout epiphany - info only, do not submode","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Nobility","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","Implant Index","A Breakout Epiphany is a spiritual 'peak experience', an awakening to the divine s love in a burst of freedom or sudden beauty.
