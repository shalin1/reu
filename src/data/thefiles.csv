This identity’s accumulated memories and forces enable one to get contextual perspective on its present enactment within oneself as this seeding source’s force pattern will tend to echo whatever issue is being dealt with in this session.  
By compassionately opening to, and understanding, the source of this echoing force pattern within one, a clearer and more multi dimensional perspective on the enactment of these forces in present time can be attained.
Note: When a submode here refers to a pre-body, realize that the pre-body is carrying whole life recordings of all the life forms it has entered and exited from in the physical universe. In faciitations for the pre-body therefore, the lives within them should also all be involved. 
Once the seeding source is found, have the client feel the seeding source’s presence with them - greet the seeding source and feel the seeding source greeting the client in return. 

Seeding source is generally assessed at the beginning of the session, but note that it can be assessed instead at any time later in the session if this feels more appropriate.

Note: If Seeding will not go in, reassess the ISelf Recognitions level and tap in to establish the session on a more appropriate awareness level, then recheck this file. If Seeding is still blocked, ask if the identity is one incarnated on another planet (indicate, use Off World page and Tap In).

or b) if one goes into weakness with no active hand towards the end of the session, but the *Resolving mode will not go in on either one or both hands. At this point check the Gates files (Entry, Truth, Ability, Helpmode* or General Facilitation) and if any one of these creates change, handle per their pages. However, if none of these create change, use the But mode and if it goes in, assess and follow its trail. If still no active hand, load CRF and if it goes in assess and follow its trail. But  if *Resolving will still not go in after all that, load Code and if that goes in, run per procedure.

Note: Processing refers to a period of time during which the inner reconfigures itself in response to what has been input from the outer world. In order to do this, the TimeISelf ‘lets go’ of the outer world by rendering the body to sleep or some other form of unconsciousness. Yawning or tiredness
is often a signal that the TimeISelf is calling for such a reconfiguration.

 Displacement ,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Seeding,,,,,,,,Identity,Untitled.pct,"In life, Displacement is the phenomenon of another being presenting itself to one while one is in communication with someone else, or the feeling of something or someone shadowing one’s interchange with another. 
In a session, When Displacement comes up, the client’s ‘wants handled’ is actually being sourced via a mutual implant with whoever or whatever is found to be shadowing the original seeding source.

Procedure: 
1) If the seeding source is not yet located, find the Seeding 13 being. Then reassess the whole Seeding file to get the being who is shadowing this seeding source (do not follow this second identity’s Seeding goto if there is one). 
2) Then go to Identity and follow its goto trail - this will be for the original seeding source or for the Seeding 13 identity that was seeded first. Do the appropriate facilitation for the now completed paragraph (no need to follow the paragraph’s facilitation goto trail if there is one). 
3) Next, start a new paragraph by going to Identity again for the second identity found that is shadowing the first seeding source or Seeding 13 identity, and again follow its Identity goto trail and facilitate with the first facilitation file to come up in that paragraph (again, no need to follow that facilitation’s goto trail if there is one).  
If the session continues now, the second shadowing identity is treated as the seeding source for the remainder of the session. 
Note: If Implant comes up in either Identity paragraph, or later in the session, it is active in both seeding sources.

‘The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled.

‘It’s a strange thing about the human mind that, despite its capacity and its abundant freedom, its default is to function in a repeating pattern. It watches the moon and the planets, the days and seasons, the cycle of life and death all going around in an endless loop, and unconsciously, believing itself to be nature, the mind echoes these cycles. Its thoughts go in loops, repeating patterns established so long ago we often can’t remember their origin, or why they ever made sense to us. And even when these loops fail over and over again to bring us to a desirable place, even while they entrap us, and make us feel anciently tired of ourselves, and we sense that sticking to their well-worn path means we’ll miss contact with the truth every single time, we still find it nearly impossible to resist them. We call these patterns of thought our “nature” and resign ourselves to being governed by them as if they are the result of a force outside of us, the way that the seas are governed — rather absurdly, when one thinks about it — by a distant and otherwise irrelevant moon.’ - Nicole Krauss

This engraved  ‘coding’ lurks within us and colors our life thenceforth with a background stress that can further compound into further distress, anxiety and illness for ourselves and for our heirs.
Trauma codes themselves are vivid interference patterns seeded into the life energy that flows through our central core, and express themselves outwards through the dimensional chakras which emanate from this central core.
As with all major force patterns, trauma codes are best healed by our empathic understanding of their source, structure and impact.

‘All of us labor in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity. Haunted by wrong turns and roads not taken, we pursue images perceived as new but whose providence dates to the dim dramas of childhood, which are themselves but ripples of consequence echoing down the generations.’ - William Faulkner

This is a Dimension 1 yang coding for a command patterning established in and from a trauma.
The acupuncture point indicates its position in the vessel (TL whether it is inside or on the surface of the body, or out in the field away from the body).
*Once the code and its goto trail is found, then go to Crisis Outer to determine the trauma that installed this code, and then to Crisis Inner to determine the inner consequences of the code.

One’s own or others’ evil intentions towards one tend to become stored in the field, forever effecting one’s outlook and confidence.  Whatever their source, from these vengeful intentions grows a slow unraveling of one’s hopefulness, integrity and strength. 
Evil intentions are the basis for personal and collective insanity.

When an evil or cruel intention is revealed in session, immediately do the Monster process.

The ‘seven deadly sins’, and other such cautionary listings found in each culture, are perhaps attempts to indicate those factors that prevent one from understanding one’s true nature as a player of this game. By lifting away these factors, pieces become players, and the game becomes a divinely ordained and exciting fulfillment.

Making others wrong in order to exclude them or to make oneself right is a negating human tendency that has been acted out within most cultures, religions, social paradigms, or families throughout time. However, the derisive force that makes one want to make others or oneself bad, or project onto them the role of ‘sinners’, is directly contrary to the unconditional generosity of the divine and its reflection within the nobility of our inner selves. Such action therefore falsifies our true humanity and takes us on an errant, egotistical or power seeking path.

IMPLANT FACILITATION TAKES PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER FACILITATIONS: 

1) Assess Implant Trance for the nature of the implant trance.
2) TL for the horizontal gauzy disk lying centered on the central axis of the body at the area indicated.
3) Oneself and the seeding source together experience the appropriate prayer per the right column. 
4) Lovingly flood the gauzy disk in oneself at its darkened center with a rapidly pulsing liquid brilliance and then let the flashing light spread out horizontally until the disk flares away and ‘disappears’ and there is a perceived energy flow between the chakras on either side of the disk’s former position.
5) Similarly, on their behalf, flood the seeding source at the same gauzy disk TL with a rapidly pulsing liquid brilliance until they ’flare’ into the Breakout epiphany, receiving it as a divine blessing. 
6) (Muscle test to confirm that this step is necessary. If so...) Then flood one’s siblings and children, or other beings one has loved or who have come up in the session, in the same way until the Breakout releases them as well.
7) Allow oneself to experience the Breakout for oneself, Tap In, then lovingly share how good that feels with the seeding source and the other individuals who may have come up in the session, and then physically applaud that feeling. Tap Up.

In falling prey to a surging implant, oneself and the seeding source become wrapped by this dark trance space that enforces receptivity to the forces trailing off the implant. 
This file describes the 'stuff' of these implant trances, the feeling glue that sticks the implant onto the forces within oneself.

",Untitled.pct,"Implants are frequencies originally inserted into the physical and pre-body universe by the mutual agreement and unconditional love of free beings in order to enable each being entering this universe to experience the broad spectrum of its reality and to prompt its journey back to the divine. 
But an implant also creates a pipeline that transmits forces between individuals who are holding the same implant.
Thus, an Implant is often the root adhesive for the forces in the session, the magnet by which the client, the seeding source and other beings who 
share the Implant mutually hold onto and express their forces.  
Implants, like dreams we cannot wake up from, permeate us with background trances (see Implant Trance) made up of our self generated limitations. In running the Implant procedure, we can realize our release from these limitations through the epiphany of unconditional love that is on the other side of each implant (see Implant Breakout) . 
Implants create ‘flinch images’ imprinted on the life force systems of the beings sharing the Implant (see Implant Facilitation Image). 

‘A new appetite develops within him, the hunger for real awakening, for full consciousness. He realizes that he sees, hears, knows only a tiny fraction of what he could see, hear and know, that he lives in the poorest, shabbiest of the rooms in his inner dwelling, but that he could enter other rooms, beautiful and filled with treasures, the windows of which look out on eternity and infinity....’ - Robert DeRopp, 'The Master Game’

Note 1: Implant facilitation takes precedence over any other paragraph facilitation.
Note 2: If the implant’s facilitation does not create resolving, then it is likely an an activating code has not yet resolved. If this is the case, facilitate the code found in the session. If there was no code found, load the Code handmode and if it goes in, handle per procedure - If it does not go in, try loading  But, CRF or Entry and handle. If none of these work to create resolving, have the client talk about how the session has been for them, Tap In and then try this Code//But/CRF/Entry sequence again.

IMPLANT FACILITATION TAKES PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER FACILITATIONS:

1) Assess Implant Trance for the feeling of the implant trance.
2) Match implant with its Breakout epiphany. 
3) Assess Implant Facilitation Image to get the flinch image to visualize at the implant position. 
4) Lovingly flood the image with a rapidly pulsing liquid brilliance until the image flares away and there is nothing left but expanding light.
5) On their behalf, flood that same facilitation image at the same TL in the visualized seeding source with a rapidly pulsing liquid brilliance until it flares and the Breakout releases in them. 
6) (Muscle test to confirm that this step is necessary. If so...) Then flood the image in one’s siblings and children, or other beings one has loved, with the same pulsing liquid brilliance until the Breakout releases in them as well.
7) Allow oneself to experience the Breakout for oneself, Tap In, then lovingly share how good that feels with the seeding source and the other individuals who may have come up in the session, and then physically applaud that feeling. Tap Up.

Rescuers are transformative commands, paradigm shifts created by the graceful generosity of awakened beings, that profoundly change an individual at the deepest levels, and are used to rescue them from loveless self-destruction. Experienced as a sudden insight from a guardian presence, each command initiates a dramatic turning point in one’s life. 
On a broader basis, Rescuers is the transformation of the human race from evolutionary growth by fear into revolutionary growth by love. Rescuers is, in essence, the expression of the transmuting power granted one in a ReUnion session. 
If called to this file, it indicates that with the ongoing release of forces, one is being invited at this moment to support and add power to an ongoing Rescuers command. This command may also indicate what this session is trying to do after one has processed the surrounding force patterns that are coming up in the session.

To prevent falling into what one fears to be the bottomless pit of uncertainty about the future, one retreats into an artificial certainty by discarding the open possibilities of one’s infinite life. Clutch is about jammed reflectiveness and taking on rigid and limiting belief systems that justify one’s fear of experiencing freedom. Because such belief systems are based on misinformation disguised as the truth in order to create tribal binding, those with an active Clutch force can only retain their certainty by both manipulating others to believe the same way as they do (cults, sects, etc.) and by forcefully resisting any efforts by others to reveal the falsity of their belief. Examples of such false certainties include, amongst many, those based on the final and literal truth of mere stories, the belief in elitism, or the justifying of harm to others as the ‘right’ thing to do.

",Suppression,JOY,FEELPOWER,Ascend,Untitled.pct,"ID Archetype discloses the subtle archetypes that serve as ‘framing wire’ for the self’s construction of identities within the material world. Ancestral, true other life and pre-body programming and the fury of their forces fill the field and the flesh, but are all held together in ‘body form’ by these basic identity paradigms. Each archetype points towards the self’s choice of a ‘piece for the game’, and can be internally perceived as one’s sense of ‘destiny’.
Once dreamed by the self, the purity of these 32 ‘destiny’ archetypes is then dressed in the power of collective, ancestral, true other life and pre-body forces, and the resulting multitiered field is then unfolded into the material world as the human before you.
Release of the forces in the human eventually allows the archetype ‘room’ to come forward and present itself as one’s greater reality.
This file alerts one to an ‘aching’ inner archetype within one that is struggling to overcome the forces built upon it.

Facilitate immediately by TLing the field for the location of the ID Archetype on hand. Tap In, then command ‘Put your attention there (the TL) and become (the archetype).’ Tap Up.

Disruption of this innate unwinding can overwhelm one with the weight of unprocessed forces. Conversely, by following the ‘hot’ thread of forces imaged within a dream, processing can be taken to its fulfillment of a clean release of the impacting forces. 
Membrane refers to an event horizon, embedded with the implants, which surrounds the overall dream of this universe being generated by the beings within it. It is, in essence, a skin of suffering and self-limitation that acts as a ‘defense’ against ourselves as infinite creators,  
This membrane holds the ‘defense’ together by trapping the force trails of the implants that are keeping each being in the dream and halting their processing. Without the membrane barrier calling in the limits of a being’s experience, the physical universe dream would process out and ‘disappear’ and the being would realize themselves as an infinite creator. 
The purpose of this file is to untangle the individual’s menu of ‘defensive’ implant activation so that one’s entrapment in the material dream causatively transcended.

Important: Membrane indicates a shift in one’s awareness towards a more lucid existence (full scale awareness that one is dreaming this existence) with a consequent growth in intimacy and compassion. Membrane will thus have a tendency to open one up to others’ inner worlds and the forces that are emanating from them but without one unwillingly resonating with them. 

Use: After assessing the file, ask ‘Create a dream image of (submode content)’, Tap In, and continue with the goto. 
The Membrane Facilitation is done just after the session’s  *Resolving helpmode goes in.

Run the next paragraph if there is a still active hand or a facilitation goto demands it. Membrane is facilitated just after *Resolving helpmode goes in. This furthers the depth of the session’s processing.

‘Close your eyes and feel a black balloon of rubbery energy completely enclosing you and the seeding source ... Together begin projecting beams of white light into the balloon’s inner surface, causing white holes to appear in it, like shining stars ... Continue this process until the balloon finally bursts or shatters completely ... And the seeding source’s and your own presence expand quickly outward. Take a big breath and feel the resulting restful release for both you and the seeding source.’ Tap Up.

 *Unity helpmode,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ii,Untitled.pct,"*Unity is a special helpmode that addresses the fear of what is ‘out there’ awaiting us in the vastness beyond the Membrane and reflected culturally as the fear of death. It addresses any deeply ingrained implants that are in activation as a ‘defense’ against ourselves as infinite creators.
 *Unity’s task is to allow one to transcend the frightening encroachment of what is light and good by what is dark and evil. Such inner spiritual warfare, haunting us at the level of our deepest fears, can make us hesitate to unconditionally join in union with the awakened beings waiting for us beyond materiality.
Procedure: Load the helpmode in the active hand, tap in. Envision an angelic being hovering before and slightly above you. Tap In. Watch the angelic being suddenly turn black, becoming a ‘dark angel’. Tap In. Watch and feel the original angelic being reappear by dissolving the ‘dark angel’ in front of it with white light until the original angelic being is present again. Tap In. If necessary, repeat this back and forth cycle until the angelic being has a diamond brilliance and feels entirely present on your behalf. Tap In. Open yourself to this now brightly shining angelic being, and feel the love between you. Tap Up. 
Then, reassess Implant Index to get the deeply ingrained implant, follow its goto trail and facilitate it.

To prevent falling into what one fears to be the bottomless pit of uncertainty about the future, one retreats into an artificial certainty by discarding the open possibilities of one’s infinite life. Clutch is about jammed reflectiveness and taking on rigid and limiting belief systems that justify one’s fear of experiencing freedom. Because such belief systems are based on misinformation disguised as the truth in order to create tribal binding, those with an active Clutch force can only retain their certainty by both manipulating others to believe the same way as they do (cults, sects, etc.) and by forcefully resisting any efforts by others to reveal the falsity of their belief. Examples of such false certainties include, amongst many, those based on the final and literal truth of mere stories, the belief in elitism, or the justifying of harm to others as the ‘right’ thing to do.

‘All of us labor in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity. Haunted by wrong turns and roads not taken, we pursue images perceived as new but whose providence dates to the dim dramas of childhood, which are themselves but ripples of consequence echoing down the generations.’ - William Faulkner

This is a Dimension 7 CV1-CV3 yin coding for a command patterning established in and from a trauma.
The acupuncture point indicates its position in the vessel (TL whether it is inside or on the surface of the body, or out in the field away from the body).*Once the code and its goto trail is found, then go to Crisis Outer to determine the trauma that installed this code, and then to Crisis Inner to determine the inner consequences of the code.
*Once the above is done, go to Code Facilitation and handle (unless an Implant is present, in which case implant facilitation takes precedence).

*Empathic resonance is numerical coding that the inner uses as a catalyst to uncover, loosen, and disperse forces at hand. By such numerical empathy, the resonances aid in releasing the inner’s grip on its own wounds.
After the mode is put in, crossed over and Tapped In, each number of the resonance is put in the active hand, crossed over and Tapped In. On completion, take a big breath and feel the energy settle. Tap In. Tap Up.

This binding energy can act as an overriding influence on each member of the collective - referred to here as the Collective Resonance Field.
Out of our innate love for others, we take on the burden of these collectives in order to heal them. By releasing our collectives from their mutual Implant resonance, each being within those collectives becomes bonded to one by love instead of force, and one’s unique spaciousness then becomes one’s own again. 

Signals for heavily imposing CRFs include nagging irritability, belittlement of oneself or others, physical deterioration, pest infestations, unwanted odors, things breaking. Street and pharmaceutical drugs and alcohol often magnify CRF impingement.

An electronic circuit signals a fearful loss of safety, an inappropriate state that repeats relentlessly in the consciousness, particularly when the vessel is permeated by illness or severe stress. Because an electronic circuit can be so arduously repetitive, it can interfere with the attainment of theta-delta sleep waves, and thus the processing of the illness or stress through dreaming is interrupted.

After the mode is put in, crossed over and tapped in, each number of the resonance is put in the active hand, crossed over and Tapped in. On completion, take a big breath and feel the energy settle. Tap in. Tap up. "

However, a collective can also generate a binding entrapment should the common inner experience be part of an active Implant held mutually by the members of the collective. This binding energy can act as an overriding influence on each member of the collective - referred to here as the Collective Resonance Field.
Out of our innate love for others, we take on the burden of these collectives in order to heal them. By releasing our collectives from their mutual Implant resonance, each being within those collectives becomes bonded to one by love instead of force, and one’s unique spaciousness then becomes one’s own again. 

Signals for heavily imposing CRFs include nagging irritability, belittlement of oneself or others, physical deterioration, pest infestations, unwanted odors, things breaking. Street and pharmaceutical drugs and alcohol often magnify CRF impingement.

",1,5,,,,,The feeling of being overwhelmed by  things persistently failing to turn out the way one hopes for,Feelings that lead one astray from one’s true direction are painfully entrapping one,Feeling chronically brought down into an unwanted emotion,Feelings that will not allow letting go of things,Fortune,ASTRAY,Tone,Yoke,A paradigm (Story) adopted by the seeding source has been torturously dissolving one’s hopeful expectations,The seeding source’s invasive fear and confusion here has been bewildering one’s sense of joy and growth,The seeding source’s inner turmoil has been jamming one’s belief in being able to break out into triumph ,There is a feeling in one here that one will be let down or that one is not seeing the truth ,Trust,Lineage,Blinded,Survival,The seeding source’s anxious frustration and despair has for some time been stifling one’s warrior spirit,The self suppression behind the seeding source’s struggle showing up here needs a transformative resolution,This is a pattern here of being constantly permeated by the feeling that one is going to be let down,Now is the time to take on the seeding source’s dark disharmony clouding one here and boldly heal it  ,INTRUDER*,DEMONIC*,*Tension Point,Weary,The seeding source’s pattern is of not being in charge of their life and sensing a slow dismantling,The pain and uncertainty that interferes with one’s healing and renewal here,"As ones struggles to find Grace again, the arrogance and deceit in others is becoming more evident","With this within one, one can particularly feel a debilitating loss of heart regarding one’s value in others’ lives",Trespassing,OBFUSCATE,Dark Levels,HEART,A sense of separation from the powerful ability to attract one once knew is leading one to fall into despair,What is here is the seeding source’s aloneness (can be the aftermath of rape) and heartfelt need for love,"There is the inner tension of fear, disappointment and distrust here",There are feelings within the seeding source that are turning the power of one’s hopes against oneself ,Hunger,Illness,Courage,Inversion,One is being permeated by the seeding source’s frustration and sense of defeat,One is sabotaging oneself with an unresolved conflict between one’s feeling heart and thinking mind,The seeding source’s memory of an emotionally charged trauma is veiling one’s consciousness,"With this, one has felt gripped by a tense heaviness embedded with rejection and envy",Res Change,Ancestor,Hallways,Crisis Outer,This has generated a persistent sense of being unappreciated and of feeling one’s hopes are going to fail,"Anxious indifference, rigidity, coldness",This gloomy state includes jealousy and suspicion with a self demeaning lack of confidence in oneself,An overwrought feeling coming from the seeding source is imprisoning one in worry and fear,Wholeness,Rising,Qi Dark Yang,Res Worry,Being overcome by stubbornness and boredom,Anger and unforgiving attack,"Antagonism, shame and distrust about one’s fate",Feelings of being overpowered or ‘starved out’ of existence,Rut,Compartment,Powerdrive,Overpower,Untitled.pct,"By its very nature the emotional self is a liquid resonance, flowing and  changing, alighting  on a situation and coloring it, delicately or forcefully, with  specific feelings.
Sometimes, however, this liquid resonance becomes frozen, and the feelings are held to specific forms and patterns not always appropriate to the situation at hand. Trapped under such rigid cloaking of held feeling, one’s inner dignity and noble passion can decay, one’s outlook can feel inappropriate or ‘off’ in some way, and that which inhabits one’s life begins to suffer from a darkly held emotional discoloration. 
Held helps locate this discoloring so that the integrity of one’s feelings can be restored and made whole again.

Freespirit detects the possible forces that chain one’s higher nature to body consciousness and the compressions of a physical universe.
